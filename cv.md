## About Me:

I have been working at the mine for more than 10 years, of which I have been in charge of the geological service for more than 7 years. Tired of routine work at a state enterprise, I want to try myself in a new profession, where you can constantly develop and prove yourself, where specialists are valued for their real knowledge and skills, and not for connections and acquaintances, and money is earned, but not received.
